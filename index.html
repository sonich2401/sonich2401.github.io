				This project was the child of my collison experiments. The objective of the game was to reach the end of the level without hitting one of the colored bars. Version 1 was really a sperate file than version 2 because i wanted a fresh start. Version one has the character moving throughout the level whereas version 2 consisted of the level geometry moving while the character could only move up and down. The collison is messed up becuase I couldn't figure out why the character kept diying whilst not touching the walls. Today i solved the issue, however, in version 2 this still presists. My band-aid solution back in the day to the issue was to make it so the collsison was realtive to what the x,y values of the entire monitor display were subtracted by where the window poped up. This fixed the issue 25% of the time.
